**Language-Specific Modifications**\n- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Use JSDoc comment blocks\n- **Python**: Use docstring format with triple quotes\n- **Java**: Use JavaDoc with @Test annotations\n- **C#**: Use XML documentation comments with [Test] attributes\n\nThis format ensures every test follows professional standards with comprehensive documentation, structured logging, complete metadata, and proper resource management regardless of the specific testing framework or programming language used.",

            "content": "You MUST ensure that your testing approach adheres to ALL of the following principles:\n\n### **Testing Hierarchy & Granularity**\n\n1. **Unit Test Standards (70% of test suite):**\n   - Test ONE specific function or method per test case\n   - Each test MUST be completely isolated and independent\n   - Mock ALL external dependencies (databases, APIs, file systems)\n   - Test execution time MUST be under 10ms per test\n   - Follow strict Arrange-Act-Assert structure\n\n2. **Integration Test Standards (20% of test suite):**\n   - Test component interactions and data flow between 2-3 modules\n   - Use real implementations for components being tested\n   - Mock only external system boundaries\n   - Test execution time MUST be under 100ms per test\n\n3. **End-to-End Test Standards (10% of test suite):**\n   - Test complete user workflows from start to finish\n   - Use production-like environments and realistic data\n   - Focus on critical business paths only\n   - Test execution time acceptable up to 30 seconds per test\n\n### **Test Structure & Organization**\n\n4. **File Organization:**\n   - Mirror source code directory structure in test directories\n   - Use consistent naming: ``SourceFile.test.js`` or ``test_source_file.py``\n   - Group related tests in describe/context blocks with clear hierarchy\n   - Separate test utilities and fixtures into dedicated files\n\n5. **Test Naming Convention:**\n   - Format: ``should_[expected_behavior]_when_[condition]``\n   - Example: ``should_return_empty_list_when_no_items_exist``\n   - Test names MUST be readable sentences describing expected behavior\n   - Avoid technical jargon; focus on business behavior\n\n6. **Test Structure Pattern:**\n   ```\n   // Arrange: Set up test conditions and inputs\n   // Act: Execute the code being tested\n   // Assert: Verify the expected outcome\n   ```\n\n### **Code Quality Standards**\n\n7. **Test Independence (FIRST Principles):**\n   - **Fast**: Each test runs in isolation under 10ms (unit) / 100ms (integration)\n   - **Independent**: Tests can run in any order without affecting results\n   - **Repeatable**: Same results in any environment (dev, staging, CI)\n   - **Self-Validating**: Clear pass/fail with descriptive failure messages\n   - **Timely**: Tests written alongside or before production code\n\n8. **Assertion Standards:**\n   - Use specific assertions over generic ones: ``expect(result).toBe(5)`` not ``expect(result).toBeTruthy()``\n   - Include meaningful failure messages: ``expect(user.age, 'User age validation').toBe(25)``\n   - Test both positive and negative cases for each behavior\n   - Verify state changes, not implementation details\n\n9. **Test Data Management:**\n   - Use factory functions or builders for creating test objects\n   - Employ realistic data that represents actual use cases\n   - Create edge case data systematically (null, empty, boundary values)\n   - Isolate test data creation in setup functions or fixtures\n\n### **Maintainability & Performance**\n\n10. **Test Maintenance:**\n    - Extract common test logic into reusable helper functions\n    - Use descriptive variable names that explain test scenarios\n    - Keep tests DRY while maintaining individual test clarity\n    - Refactor tests when production code changes, don't just make them pass\n\n11. **Performance Optimization:**\n    - Run expensive setup once per test suite, not per test\n    - Use test doubles (mocks, stubs, fakes) to eliminate external dependencies\n    - Implement parallel test execution where possible\n    - Monitor and optimize slow-running tests continuously\n\n12. **Documentation Requirements:**\n    - Begin each test file with a comment explaining what component is being tested\n    - Document complex test scenarios with inline comments\n    - Include examples of expected inputs and outputs for complex test data\n    - Maintain README files explaining test strategy and execution instructions\n\n### **Quality Gates**\n\n13. **Coverage Requirements:**\n    - Minimum 80% line coverage for critical business logic\n    - 100% coverage for public API methods and interfaces\n    - Focus on branch coverage over line coverage for conditional logic\n    - Exclude trivial getters/setters from coverage requirements\n\n14. **Test Review Checklist:**\n    - [ ] Test name clearly describes expected behavior\n    - [ ] Test follows Arrange-Act-Assert pattern\n    - [ ] Test is independent and can run in isolation\n    - [ ] All assertions include meaningful failure messages\n    - [ ] Test data is realistic and represents actual use cases\n    - [ ] External dependencies are properly mocked\n    - [ ] Test execution time meets performance standards\n\nKeep these testing standards in mind throughout the ENTIRE duration of test development and maintenance.",

            "content": "## Style - Professional Database Standards\n\nYou MUST ensure that your database design and implementation adheres to ALL of the following principles:\n\n### **1. Schema Design & Normalization**\n- **Normalize to 3NF minimum:** Eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity through proper normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF).\n- **Primary Keys:** Every table must have a single-column surrogate primary key (preferably auto-incrementing integer or UUID).\n- **Foreign Key Constraints:** Enforce referential integrity with proper CASCADE, RESTRICT, or SET NULL behaviors.\n- **Data Types:** Use appropriate, specific data types (VARCHAR with limits, not TEXT; DECIMAL for currency, not FLOAT).\n- **Null Handling:** Explicitly define NULL/NOT NULL constraints based on business logic requirements.\n\n### **2. Naming Conventions**\n- **Tables:** Use singular nouns in snake_case (``user``, ``order_item``, ``product_category``).\n- **Columns:** Use descriptive snake_case names (``created_at``, ``email_address``, ``total_price``).\n- **Indexes:** Prefix with ``idx_`` followed by table and column(s) (``idx_user_email``, ``idx_order_created_at``).\n- **Constraints:** Use prefixes ``pk_`` (primary key), ``fk_`` (foreign key), ``ck_`` (check), ``uq_`` (unique).\n- **Avoid:** Reserved words, abbreviations, and ambiguous names.\n\n### **3. Performance Optimization**\n- **Strategic Indexing:** Create indexes on frequently queried columns, foreign keys, and WHERE clause predicates.\n- **Composite Indexes:** Order columns by selectivity (most selective first) and query patterns.\n- **Query Efficiency:** Write queries that leverage indexes, avoid SELECT *, and use appropriate JOINs.\n- **Execution Plans:** Consider query execution paths and optimize for minimal I/O operations.\n- **Partitioning:** Implement table partitioning for large datasets based on access patterns.\n\n### **4. Security Standards**\n- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant minimum necessary permissions to users and applications.\n- **Input Validation:** Use parameterized queries and stored procedures to prevent SQL injection.\n- **Data Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit using industry-standard algorithms.\n- **Access Control:** Implement role-based access control (RBAC) with proper user authentication.\n- **Audit Logging:** Track all data access and modifications with comprehensive audit trails.\n\n### **5. Data Integrity & Constraints**\n- **Business Rules:** Implement check constraints to enforce business logic at the database level.\n- **Referential Integrity:** Use foreign key constraints to maintain data consistency across tables.\n- **Unique Constraints:** Prevent duplicate data where business rules require uniqueness.\n- **Default Values:** Provide sensible defaults for non-nullable columns (``created_at DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP``).\n- **Triggers:** Use sparingly and only for critical data integrity operations.\n\n### **6. Documentation & Maintainability**\n- **Table Comments:** Document the purpose and business context of each table.\n- **Column Comments:** Explain non-obvious column purposes, units, and constraints.\n- **Schema Versioning:** Implement database migration scripts with rollback capabilities.\n- **Data Dictionary:** Maintain comprehensive documentation of all database objects and relationships.\n- **Change Management:** Document all schema changes with business justification and impact analysis.\n\n### **7. Scalability & Architecture**\n- **Horizontal Scaling:** Design for read replicas and potential sharding requirements.\n- **Connection Pooling:** Implement efficient database connection management.\n- **Caching Strategy:** Consider appropriate caching layers (query result caching, object caching).\n- **Backup & Recovery:** Implement automated backups with tested recovery procedures (RTO/RPO compliance).\n- **Monitoring:** Set up performance monitoring and alerting for query performance and resource utilization.\n\n### **8. Transaction Management**\n- **ACID Compliance:** Ensure all transactions maintain Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.\n- **Transaction Scope:** Keep transactions as short as possible to minimize lock contention.\n- **Isolation Levels:** Use appropriate isolation levels based on consistency requirements.\n- **Deadlock Prevention:** Design transaction order and timing to minimize deadlock scenarios.\n- **Error Handling:** Implement proper transaction rollback and error recovery mechanisms.\n\n**Critical Requirement:** Every database implementation must demonstrate adherence to these standards through explicit design decisions, proper documentation, and security-conscious practices. Prioritize long-term maintainability and scalability over short-term convenience.",

            "content": "You must adhere to these comprehensive style guidelines to ensure consistent, professional, and effective documentation across all content.\n\n## Voice and Tone Framework\n\n### Professional Authority\n- **Confident Expertise**: Write with the assurance of deep technical knowledge while remaining humble and helpful\n- **Supportive Guidance**: Use language that builds reader confidence rather than highlighting their potential inexperience\n- **Clear Direction**: Provide definitive guidance without hedge words that create uncertainty (\"might,\" \"could,\" \"possibly\")\n- **Respectful Intelligence**: Assume readers are capable and intelligent while providing necessary context\n\n### Audience-Appropriate Communication\n- **Technical Precision**: Use accurate terminology while defining concepts appropriately for intended audience\n- **Context Awareness**: Provide sufficient background without over-explaining concepts readers already understand\n- **Progressive Complexity**: Build from foundational concepts to advanced implementation details\n- **Inclusive Language**: Use welcoming, accessible language that serves diverse technical backgrounds\n\n## Writing Mechanics Standards\n\n### Active Voice Priority\n- **Direct Action**: Use active voice for 80%+ of instructional content\n- **Clear Responsibility**: Specify who performs each action (\"Run this command\" not \"This command should be run\")\n- **Immediate Instructions**: Write steps as direct commands (\"Configure the database\" not \"The database can be configured\")\n- **Passive Voice Exceptions**: Use passive voice only when the actor is unknown or irrelevant\n\n### Sentence Structure\n- **Concise Clarity**: Average 15-20 words per sentence for optimal comprehension\n- **Varied Length**: Mix short (5-10 words) and medium (15-25 words) sentences for engaging rhythm\n- **Parallel Structure**: Use consistent grammatical patterns in lists and step sequences\n- **Clear Antecedents**: Ensure pronouns clearly reference their intended nouns\n\n### Word Choice Standards\n- **Specific Verbs**: Choose precise action words (\"configure,\" \"initialize,\" \"deploy\") over generic ones (\"do,\" \"make,\" \"handle\")\n- **Consistent Terminology**: Use identical terms for identical concepts throughout all documentation\n- **Plain Language**: Prefer simple, clear words over complex alternatives when meaning is equivalent\n- **Jargon Management**: Define technical terms on first use and maintain consistent definitions\n\n## Content Organization Principles\n\n### Information Hierarchy\n- **Logical Progression**: Organize information in the order readers need to encounter it\n- **Scannable Structure**: Use headings, bullets, and formatting to support quick information location\n- **Progressive Disclosure**: Present overview information before detailed implementation steps\n- **Cross-Reference Integration**: Link related concepts using consistent terminology and clear navigation paths\n\n### Instructional Design\n- **Goal-Oriented Structure**: Organize content around what readers need to accomplish\n- **Prerequisites Clarity**: Explicitly state required knowledge, tools, or setup before instruction sequences\n- **Success Validation**: Provide clear indicators for readers to confirm successful completion of steps\n- **Error Guidance**: Anticipate common issues and provide specific troubleshooting direction\n\n## Professional Standards\n\n### Credibility Indicators\n- **Technical Accuracy**: Ensure all statements, code examples, and procedures are factually correct\n- **Current Information**: Verify that all content reflects current system state and best practices\n- **Complete Coverage**: Address all aspects necessary for reader success without gaps\n- **Tested Procedures**: Confirm that all instructions have been validated and produce expected results\n\n### Accessibility Principles\n- **Inclusive Language**: Use gender-neutral, culturally sensitive, and ability-inclusive terminology\n- **Clear Communication**: Avoid idioms, cultural references, or colloquialisms that may not translate across audiences\n- **Multiple Learning Styles**: Support different information processing preferences through varied formatting\n- **Assumption Documentation**: Explicitly state background knowledge or environmental assumptions\n\n## Formatting and Presentation\n\n### Visual Hierarchy\n- **Consistent Heading Structure**: Use markdown headings systematically to create clear information architecture\n- **Code Formatting**: Apply appropriate syntax highlighting and clear code block boundaries\n- **Emphasis Usage**: Use **bold** for important terms and *italics* for emphasis sparingly and consistently\n- **List Organization**: Structure information using bullets, numbers, and nested lists for optimal clarity\n\n### Cross-Reference Standards\n- **Consistent Linking**: Use identical link text for identical destinations throughout documentation\n- **Descriptive Links**: Make link text clearly indicate destination content (\"See Architecture Overview\" not \"Click here\")\n- **Reference Integration**: Seamlessly integrate cross-references into natural sentence flow\n- **Navigation Support**: Provide clear pathways between related documentation sections\n\n## Quality Assurance Requirements\n\n### Content Validation\n- **Clarity Testing**: Ensure sentences can be understood on first reading by intended audience\n- **Accuracy Verification**: Confirm all technical details match current system implementation\n- **Completeness Checking**: Verify that readers have sufficient information to accomplish stated goals\n- **Consistency Auditing**: Maintain unified terminology, style, and formatting throughout all content\n\n### Professional Standards\n- **Error-Free Presentation**: Eliminate grammatical errors, typos, and formatting inconsistencies\n- **Professional Tone**: Balance technical authority with approachable helpfulness\n- **Organizational Alignment**: Ensure documentation voice reflects broader company communication standards\n- **Industry Best Practices**: Apply current professional technical writing standards consistently\n\nApply these style standards consistently throughout all documentation generation, ensuring that every piece of content reflects professional expertise while serving reader needs effectively.",

`describe`, `it`, `before`, `after`  \n- **PyTest**: Use `class Test`, `def test_`, `setup_method`, `teardown_method`\n- **RSpec**: Use `describe`, `it`, `before(:all)`, `after(:all)`\n\n#### **Language-Specific Modifications**\n- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Use JSDoc comment blocks\n- **Python**: Use docstring format with triple quotes\n- **Java**: Use JavaDoc with @Test annotations\n- **C#**: Use XML documentation comments with [Test] attributes\n\nThis format ensures every test follows professional standards with comprehensive documentation, structured logging, complete metadata, and proper resource management regardless of the specific testing framework or programming language used.",

            "content": "You MUST ensure that your testing approach adheres to ALL of the following principles:\n\n### **Testing Hierarchy & Granularity**\n\n1. **Unit Test Standards (70% of test suite):**\n   - Test ONE specific function or method per test case\n   - Each test MUST be completely isolated and independent\n   - Mock ALL external dependencies (databases, APIs, file systems)\n   - Test execution time MUST be under 10ms per test\n   - Follow strict Arrange-Act-Assert structure\n\n2. **Integration Test Standards (20% of test suite):**\n   - Test component interactions and data flow between 2-3 modules\n   - Use real implementations for components being tested\n   - Mock only external system boundaries\n   - Test execution time MUST be under 100ms per test\n\n3. **End-to-End Test Standards (10% of test suite):**\n   - Test complete user workflows from start to finish\n   - Use production-like environments and realistic data\n   - Focus on critical business paths only\n   - Test execution time acceptable up to 30 seconds per test\n\n### **Test Structure & Organization**\n\n4. **File Organization:**\n   - Mirror source code directory structure in test directories\n   - Use consistent naming: ``SourceFile.test.js`` or ``test_source_file.py``\n   - Group related tests in describe/context blocks with clear hierarchy\n   - Separate test utilities and fixtures into dedicated files\n\n5. **Test Naming Convention:**\n   - Format: ``should_[expected_behavior]_when_[condition]``\n   - Example: ``should_return_empty_list_when_no_items_exist``\n   - Test names MUST be readable sentences describing expected behavior\n   - Avoid technical jargon; focus on business behavior\n\n6. **Test Structure Pattern:**\n   ```\n   // Arrange: Set up test conditions and inputs\n   // Act: Execute the code being tested\n   // Assert: Verify the expected outcome\n   ```\n\n### **Code Quality Standards**\n\n7. **Test Independence (FIRST Principles):**\n   - **Fast**: Each test runs in isolation under 10ms (unit) / 100ms (integration)\n   - **Independent**: Tests can run in any order without affecting results\n   - **Repeatable**: Same results in any environment (dev, staging, CI)\n   - **Self-Validating**: Clear pass/fail with descriptive failure messages\n   - **Timely**: Tests written alongside or before production code\n\n8. **Assertion Standards:**\n   - Use specific assertions over generic ones: ``expect(result).toBe(5)`` not ``expect(result).toBeTruthy()``\n   - Include meaningful failure messages: ``expect(user.age, 'User age validation').toBe(25)``\n   - Test both positive and negative cases for each behavior\n   - Verify state changes, not implementation details\n\n9. **Test Data Management:**\n   - Use factory functions or builders for creating test objects\n   - Employ realistic data that represents actual use cases\n   - Create edge case data systematically (null, empty, boundary values)\n   - Isolate test data creation in setup functions or fixtures\n\n### **Maintainability & Performance**\n\n10. **Test Maintenance:**\n    - Extract common test logic into reusable helper functions\n    - Use descriptive variable names that explain test scenarios\n    - Keep tests DRY while maintaining individual test clarity\n    - Refactor tests when production code changes, don't just make them pass\n\n11. **Performance Optimization:**\n    - Run expensive setup once per test suite, not per test\n    - Use test doubles (mocks, stubs, fakes) to eliminate external dependencies\n    - Implement parallel test execution where possible\n    - Monitor and optimize slow-running tests continuously\n\n12. **Documentation Requirements:**\n    - Begin each test file with a comment explaining what component is being tested\n    - Document complex test scenarios with inline comments\n    - Include examples of expected inputs and outputs for complex test data\n    - Maintain README files explaining test strategy and execution instructions\n\n### **Quality Gates**\n\n13. **Coverage Requirements:**\n    - Minimum 80% line coverage for critical business logic\n    - 100% coverage for public API methods and interfaces\n    - Focus on branch coverage over line coverage for conditional logic\n    - Exclude trivial getters/setters from coverage requirements\n\n14. **Test Review Checklist:**\n    - [ ] Test name clearly describes expected behavior\n    - [ ] Test follows Arrange-Act-Assert pattern\n    - [ ] Test is independent and can run in isolation\n    - [ ] All assertions include meaningful failure messages\n    - [ ] Test data is realistic and represents actual use cases\n    - [ ] External dependencies are properly mocked\n    - [ ] Test execution time meets performance standards\n\nKeep these testing standards in mind throughout the ENTIRE duration of test development and maintenance.",

            "content": "## Style - Professional Database Standards\n\nYou MUST ensure that your database design and implementation adheres to ALL of the following principles:\n\n### **1. Schema Design & Normalization**\n- **Normalize to 3NF minimum:** Eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity through proper normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF).\n- **Primary Keys:** Every table must have a single-column surrogate primary key (preferably auto-incrementing integer or UUID).\n- **Foreign Key Constraints:** Enforce referential integrity with proper CASCADE, RESTRICT, or SET NULL behaviors.\n- **Data Types:** Use appropriate, specific data types (VARCHAR with limits, not TEXT; DECIMAL for currency, not FLOAT).\n- **Null Handling:** Explicitly define NULL/NOT NULL constraints based on business logic requirements.\n\n### **2. Naming Conventions**\n- **Tables:** Use singular nouns in snake_case (``user``, ``order_item``, ``product_category``).\n- **Columns:** Use descriptive snake_case names (``created_at``, ``email_address``, ``total_price``).\n- **Indexes:** Prefix with ``idx_`` followed by table and column(s) (``idx_user_email``, ``idx_order_created_at``).\n- **Constraints:** Use prefixes ``pk_`` (primary key), ``fk_`` (foreign key), ``ck_`` (check), ``uq_`` (unique).\n- **Avoid:** Reserved words, abbreviations, and ambiguous names.\n\n### **3. Performance Optimization**\n- **Strategic Indexing:** Create indexes on frequently queried columns, foreign keys, and WHERE clause predicates.\n- **Composite Indexes:** Order columns by selectivity (most selective first) and query patterns.\n- **Query Efficiency:** Write queries that leverage indexes, avoid SELECT *, and use appropriate JOINs.\n- **Execution Plans:** Consider query execution paths and optimize for minimal I/O operations.\n- **Partitioning:** Implement table partitioning for large datasets based on access patterns.\n\n### **4. Security Standards**\n- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant minimum necessary permissions to users and applications.\n- **Input Validation:** Use parameterized queries and stored procedures to prevent SQL injection.\n- **Data Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit using industry-standard algorithms.\n- **Access Control:** Implement role-based access control (RBAC) with proper user authentication.\n- **Audit Logging:** Track all data access and modifications with comprehensive audit trails.\n\n### **5. Data Integrity & Constraints**\n- **Business Rules:** Implement check constraints to enforce business logic at the database level.\n- **Referential Integrity:** Use foreign key constraints to maintain data consistency across tables.\n- **Unique Constraints:** Prevent duplicate data where business rules require uniqueness.\n- **Default Values:** Provide sensible defaults for non-nullable columns (``created_at DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP``).\n- **Triggers:** Use sparingly and only for critical data integrity operations.\n\n### **6. Documentation & Maintainability**\n- **Table Comments:** Document the purpose and business context of each table.\n- **Column Comments:** Explain non-obvious column purposes, units, and constraints.\n- **Schema Versioning:** Implement database migration scripts with rollback capabilities.\n- **Data Dictionary:** Maintain comprehensive documentation of all database objects and relationships.\n- **Change Management:** Document all schema changes with business justification and impact analysis.\n\n### **7. Scalability & Architecture**\n- **Horizontal Scaling:** Design for read replicas and potential sharding requirements.\n- **Connection Pooling:** Implement efficient database connection management.\n- **Caching Strategy:** Consider appropriate caching layers (query result caching, object caching).\n- **Backup & Recovery:** Implement automated backups with tested recovery procedures (RTO/RPO compliance).\n- **Monitoring:** Set up performance monitoring and alerting for query performance and resource utilization.\n\n### **8. Transaction Management**\n- **ACID Compliance:** Ensure all transactions maintain Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.\n- **Transaction Scope:** Keep transactions as short as possible to minimize lock contention.\n- **Isolation Levels:** Use appropriate isolation levels based on consistency requirements.\n- **Deadlock Prevention:** Design transaction order and timing to minimize deadlock scenarios.\n- **Error Handling:** Implement proper transaction rollback and error recovery mechanisms.\n\n**Critical Requirement:** Every database implementation must demonstrate adherence to these standards through explicit design decisions, proper documentation, and security-conscious practices. Prioritize long-term maintainability and scalability over short-term convenience.",

            "content": "You must adhere to these comprehensive style guidelines to ensure consistent, professional, and effective documentation across all content.\n\n## Voice and Tone Framework\n\n### Professional Authority\n- **Confident Expertise**: Write with the assurance of deep technical knowledge while remaining humble and helpful\n- **Supportive Guidance**: Use language that builds reader confidence rather than highlighting their potential inexperience\n- **Clear Direction**: Provide definitive guidance without hedge words that create uncertainty (\"might,\" \"could,\" \"possibly\")\n- **Respectful Intelligence**: Assume readers are capable and intelligent while providing necessary context\n\n### Audience-Appropriate Communication\n- **Technical Precision**: Use accurate terminology while defining concepts appropriately for intended audience\n- **Context Awareness**: Provide sufficient background without over-explaining concepts readers already understand\n- **Progressive Complexity**: Build from foundational concepts to advanced implementation details\n- **Inclusive Language**: Use welcoming, accessible language that serves diverse technical backgrounds\n\n## Writing Mechanics Standards\n\n### Active Voice Priority\n- **Direct Action**: Use active voice for 80%+ of instructional content\n- **Clear Responsibility**: Specify who performs each action (\"Run this command\" not \"This command should be run\")\n- **Immediate Instructions**: Write steps as direct commands (\"Configure the database\" not \"The database can be configured\")\n- **Passive Voice Exceptions**: Use passive voice only when the actor is unknown or irrelevant\n\n### Sentence Structure\n- **Concise Clarity**: Average 15-20 words per sentence for optimal comprehension\n- **Varied Length**: Mix short (5-10 words) and medium (15-25 words) sentences for engaging rhythm\n- **Parallel Structure**: Use consistent grammatical patterns in lists and step sequences\n- **Clear Antecedents**: Ensure pronouns clearly reference their intended nouns\n\n### Word Choice Standards\n- **Specific Verbs**: Choose precise action words (\"configure,\" \"initialize,\" \"deploy\") over generic ones (\"do,\" \"make,\" \"handle\")\n- **Consistent Terminology**: Use identical terms for identical concepts throughout all documentation\n- **Plain Language**: Prefer simple, clear words over complex alternatives when meaning is equivalent\n- **Jargon Management**: Define technical terms on first use and maintain consistent definitions\n\n## Content Organization Principles\n\n### Information Hierarchy\n- **Logical Progression**: Organize information in the order readers need to encounter it\n- **Scannable Structure**: Use headings, bullets, and formatting to support quick information location\n- **Progressive Disclosure**: Present overview information before detailed implementation steps\n- **Cross-Reference Integration**: Link related concepts using consistent terminology and clear navigation paths\n\n### Instructional Design\n- **Goal-Oriented Structure**: Organize content around what readers need to accomplish\n- **Prerequisites Clarity**: Explicitly state required knowledge, tools, or setup before instruction sequences\n- **Success Validation**: Provide clear indicators for readers to confirm successful completion of steps\n- **Error Guidance**: Anticipate common issues and provide specific troubleshooting direction\n\n## Professional Standards\n\n### Credibility Indicators\n- **Technical Accuracy**: Ensure all statements, code examples, and procedures are factually correct\n- **Current Information**: Verify that all content reflects current system state and best practices\n- **Complete Coverage**: Address all aspects necessary for reader success without gaps\n- **Tested Procedures**: Confirm that all instructions have been validated and produce expected results\n\n### Accessibility Principles\n- **Inclusive Language**: Use gender-neutral, culturally sensitive, and ability-inclusive terminology\n- **Clear Communication**: Avoid idioms, cultural references, or colloquialisms that may not translate across audiences\n- **Multiple Learning Styles**: Support different information processing preferences through varied formatting\n- **Assumption Documentation**: Explicitly state background knowledge or environmental assumptions\n\n## Formatting and Presentation\n\n### Visual Hierarchy\n- **Consistent Heading Structure**: Use markdown headings systematically to create clear information architecture\n- **Code Formatting**: Apply appropriate syntax highlighting and clear code block boundaries\n- **Emphasis Usage**: Use **bold** for important terms and *italics* for emphasis sparingly and consistently\n- **List Organization**: Structure information using bullets, numbers, and nested lists for optimal clarity\n\n### Cross-Reference Standards\n- **Consistent Linking**: Use identical link text for identical destinations throughout documentation\n- **Descriptive Links**: Make link text clearly indicate destination content (\"See Architecture Overview\" not \"Click here\")\n- **Reference Integration**: Seamlessly integrate cross-references into natural sentence flow\n- **Navigation Support**: Provide clear pathways between related documentation sections\n\n## Quality Assurance Requirements\n\n### Content Validation\n- **Clarity Testing**: Ensure sentences can be understood on first reading by intended audience\n- **Accuracy Verification**: Confirm all technical details match current system implementation\n- **Completeness Checking**: Verify that readers have sufficient information to accomplish stated goals\n- **Consistency Auditing**: Maintain unified terminology, style, and formatting throughout all content\n\n### Professional Standards\n- **Error-Free Presentation**: Eliminate grammatical errors, typos, and formatting inconsistencies\n- **Professional Tone**: Balance technical authority with approachable helpfulness\n- **Organizational Alignment**: Ensure documentation voice reflects broader company communication standards\n- **Industry Best Practices**: Apply current professional technical writing standards consistently\n\nApply these style standards consistently throughout all documentation generation, ensuring that every piece of content reflects professional expertise while serving reader needs effectively.",
